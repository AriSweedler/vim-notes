# My notes
This plugin helps me take notes. So that's cool.

It's contrived ahaha. But it's also the best.


# Installation
Install this using vim's built-in package support:

    mkdir -p ~/.vim/pack/AriSweedler/start
    cd ~/.vim/pack/AriSweedler/start
    git clone git@github.com:AriSweedler/vim-notes.git notes
    vim -u NONE -c "helptags notes/doc" -c q

Haha that's literally it. Vim is pretty cool and so are you if you're
installing my plugin.

# TODOs
TODO for Ari: Make the notes-home-directory a variable you can set? Hmmm...
that's not quite how I wanna use it. Maybe I wanna have multiple different
journals. This will require some thinking. Generally, I have only ever wanted
1 journal per computer, so I don't have to worry about having different notes
homes. And it's a variable in the bash script anyway.

TODO for Ari: Do I want to absorb the functionality of the bash script into
this vim plugin? That would make it purer, but just be taking a hammer to as
crew ahaha. Should I just add the bash script to this repo? That's kinda dumb.
But I like the concept of packaging this...
